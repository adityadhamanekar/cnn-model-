# üåø Aloe Vera Disease Classification Project

This project focuses on detecting and classifying diseases in aloe vera plants using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system identifies three conditions‚Äî**Healthy**, **Rot**, and **Rust**‚Äîto support early detection, promote sustainable farming practices, and aid farmers in maintaining healthy crops.
